# Chess by Jack McGraw

I like to play chess. I am trying to build a vastly simplified [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) for fun.

### TODO

- test, test, more testing
- handle mouse dragging piece off board
- swap black/white
- En Passant, pawn upgrade
- castle, check, checkmate
- build server to manage client websocket connections
- create "game rooms" that players can join
- basic game analytics
- play against computer option
- make it look nice
  - display available moves when piece is selected
  - board & piece color options
  - highlight board tile when dragging piece is over it
  - ...
- deploy
- ...
