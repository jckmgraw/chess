# Chess by Jack McGraw

I like to play chess. I am trying to build a vastly simplified [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) for fun.

### TODO (unordered)

- switch to server side challenge countdown
- TypeScript
- testing
- En Passant, pawn upgrade
- check, checkmate, stalemate, draw
- basic game analytics
- handle server connection issues

  - display available moves when piece is selected
  - board & piece color options
  - highlight board tile when dragging piece is over it
  - quick how to play popup
  - ...
