# Chess by Jack McGraw

I like to play chess. I am trying to build a vastly simplified [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) for fun.

### TODO (unordered)

- [server](https://github.com/jckmgraw/chess-server)
- player lobby
- switch to server side challenge countdown
- TypeScript
- testing
- En Passant, pawn upgrade
- stalemate, draw
- basic game analytics
- handle server connection issues
- client side caching
- make it look nice
  - nav buttons: close out of game, back to username screen
  - display available moves when piece is selected
  - highlight board tile when dragging piece is over it
  - simple how to play popup (link to google)
  - ...
- deploy
- user login, stats, etc.
- game timer
- site analyitics
- secure communication with server
- ...
