# Chess by Jack McGraw

I like to play chess. I am trying to build a vastly simplified [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) for fun.

### TODO

- swap black/white
- castle, check, checkmate
- display available moves when piece is selected
- build server to manage client websocket connections
- create "game rooms" that players can join
- basic game analytics
- play against computer option
- deploy
