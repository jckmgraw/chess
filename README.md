# Chess by Jack McGraw

I like to play chess. I am trying to build a vastly simplified [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) for fun.

### TODO (unordered)

- [server](https://github.com/jckmgraw/chess-server)
- TypeScript
- unit tests, general testing
- En Passant, pawn upgrade
- check, checkmate, stalemate, draw
- basic game analytics
- make it look nice
  - display available moves when piece is selected
  - board & piece color options
  - highlight board tile when dragging piece is over it
  - quick how to play popup
  - ...
- deploy
- ...
